excerpt: 'Storage processes are designed in a way to guarantee a high quality of service to its users. The service quality levels are ensured by performing the operations at an optimal frequency. Moreover, long backup off periods and high backlogs are also avoided by using trigger mechanisms. In this paper, we model these trigger mechanisms using restarting thresholds and study the underlying queueing model.'
