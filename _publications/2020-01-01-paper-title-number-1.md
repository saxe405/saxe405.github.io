excerpt: 'In this paper we model the streaming of $360^0$ videos on a VR headset using a wireless channel. We model both the intermittent behavior of the wireless channel as well as the prediction of the head position of the user. The MDP based streaming algorithm we present, guarantees a high Quality of Experience (QoE) for the headset users while ensuring that the resource usage is minimised.'
