excerpt: 'Data is increasing being stored in clouds due to the benefits of this infrastructure. In this paper we study a general queueing model of this process and numerically compute the performance measures which characterize the performance of such operations. In particular, we are able to analyze the resource usage of performing these operations as well as the Quality of Service provided to the data packets.'
