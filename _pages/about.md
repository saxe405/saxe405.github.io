I am a PhD student in the department of Telecommunications and Information Processing. In my research, i model processes such as data backups, inventory scheduling etc as a stochastic model and use Queueing theoretic methods to analyze these models. My work primarily models such processes using a discrete-time queueing system. For more details about my work, please look under publications. 

My work includes studies in the fields of Data backups to clouds, spare parts management, video streaming of 360 videos on VR-headsets.
